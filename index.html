I'm trying to build the repo of Jobs & the Job Descriptions


Application Analysts
===================================
Application analysts are responsible for the administration, monitoring and maintenance of software infrastructures and applications.

As an application analyst, you'll oversee practices and processes to ensure integrity, safety and availability of all data and applications as part of an organisation's information systems. You'll make sure that the processes needed for a business to function and succeed are running smoothly, acting as a technical point of contact to fix application and systems issues - usually on an immediate basis.

Application analysts work within IT departments alongside application developers and software engineers. You could also be involved in:

the training and support of staff in using applications
analysis and diagnosis of application errors
problem resolution in both the long and short term
design and development of existing and new applications
road testing and implementation of new applications.
Job titles vary. You may find titles such as problem analyst, technical adviser and system analyst, however your core activities are likely to be similar.

Application analysts can specialise in operating systems, applications and languages, such as:

Java
Oracle
SQL
UNIX.
Responsibilities
As an application analyst, you're responsible for:

identifying organisational need for new applications
preparing technical specification as a roadmap for software
implementing, testing and integrating new applications
performing routine system backups and upgrades

analysing error trends aimed at reducing or minimising down time
communicating messages regarding systems issues to users promptly
liaising with software suppliers to fulfil the requirements of the organisation
managing storage servers
scheduling and running regular tests to enhance the current systems and applications
identifying and developing functionality changes
maintaining documentation of key databases and linked applications.
You'll be expected to attend regular internal and external meetings to provide updates on the progress of your task and to present to users the application solutions you are proposing.

Salary
Salaries vary and are based on qualifications, certifications, specialisms and experience.

This is a relatively new job, so at this stage you won't come across application analysts with more than 20 years' experience.

Average starting salaries range from £29,000 to £32,000. For the first few years you can expect a steady pay increase.
For specialist activities, such SQL, UNIX or Bash scripting, the average starting salary can reach £45,000 to £48,000.
Additional benefits may include life insurance, private medical cover and dental plans and a company car. Bonuses are also offered.

Income figures are intended as a guide only.

Working hours
Working hours are usually 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday. You may need to work extra hours or at weekends depending on the project you are working on. There may be some flexibility with your employer on taking time off following a long day.

Contract work on projects is possible, which can be on a part-time or freelance basis.

What to expect
You'll need the ability to switch between tasks quickly and stay in control of problematic situations.
The job involves working on multiple projects at any time, often within a team.
You'll be dealing with both internal and external clients, so you need to be able to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing.
Working at computers for prolonged periods of time is a feature of the role. You may also need to move and carry equipment.
You will need to keep your knowledge up to date, as this is a fast-paced environment and new applications are being introduced constantly.
The dress code can vary depending on the organisation you work for and the type of project you're involved in.
The sector is male-dominated but ethnically diverse.
Qualifications
Although formal university qualifications are not always required, you'll be competing with others who have degrees in:

computer science
engineering
information systems
information technology
mathematics.
Strong technical skills are essential as is knowledge of, and certification in, the relevant computer language (this might be HMLS, CSS, #C, Microsoft SQL etc.) and applications.

Technical experience is highly valued and can be the deciding factor at the interview stage. Any previous relevant support experience can increase your chances of success when looking for a job.

You might be asked to provide a portfolio of your work prior to or at your interview.

Skills
You'll need to demonstrate:

excellent communication and interpersonal skills, both written and verbal
the ability to relay technical information to non-technical users and elicit clients' needs
customer service skills
problem solving
analytical skills
the ability to establish rapport with stakeholders
attention to detail
patience and understanding
the ability to work independently but also as a part of a team
project management skills
a proactive attitude
ability to work to deadlines and give realistic estimates
willingness to learn.
Work experience
Applicants with prior work experience are sought after by almost all employers. Many companies offer internships and placements, which will help you to enrich your skills and understanding of the role. Charities also look for volunteers to support their work.

Getting relevant work experience during your university studies is crucial; it is very hard to get an interview without this experience.

Get in touch with your university's careers service to receive advice on placements and find internship opportunities.

Employers
Opportunities for application analysts exist in all sectors of employment from financial services, education and public administration, to healthcare and retail. You can work across the UK and for any size of organisation.

The main players are the big organisations with well-developed IT systems. They will often run their own graduate schemes.

Look for job vancancies at:

CWJobs

The IT Job
Networking and personal contacts can also provide opportunities for freelance work. Competition is strong, as advertised jobs attract specialists from all over the world. However, the demand for jobs in IT is growing, with further growth expected over the next ten years.

Information technology is booming with new websites, applications and products. Another factor contributing to the high demand for IT specialists is the increased awareness of cyber crimes and their prevention.

Professional development
Continually updating your skills and knowledge is a requirement throughout the IT industry. This can be done through:

in-house training courses, which are more typical in larger organisations
specific application, language or operating system courses, usually provided by the product vendor
additional qualifications relating to the job such as IT service management, software testing and business intelligence. For qualifications, look to the BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT.
The Institution for Analysts and Programmers can suggest opportunities for further relevant training.

Informal training takes place among colleagues. Application analysts usually manage their own training needs.

Career prospects
As an application analyst you can be promoted within your organisation and take on more responsibility for managing projects and/or teams. You may become a team leader or senior application analyst.

Once in a post, it's common to develop in-depth knowledge of an application or language to become an expert. With experience, this leads to a higher remuneration and salary increases.

One career option for application analysts is to move from the support side of IT into the development side, i.e. into software development and testing.

Depending on aptitudes and opportunities available, some application analysts progress into business analyst or project manager roles.

An alternative path for application analysts is self-employment, mainly on a contract basis or even setting up a consultancy company.



Business Analyst
===================

As a business analyst you'll work within an organisation, helping to manage, change and plan for the future in line with their goals. This could be for one specific project, or as a permanent feature of the organisation. You'll need to understand the current organisational situation, identify future needs and create solutions to help meet those needs, usually (but not always) in relation to information and software systems.

You'll need to demonstrate excellent understanding of the way the organisation works and the sector it operates in, as you'll be helping the organisation to develop its functions, services and products to meet goals with internal and external stakeholders.

You'll also play a key role in communicating between internal departments and external parties, acting as a 'translator' where necessary to convey how information technology can support the organisation's needs.

A business analyst may also be known as:

business architect
business systems analyst
enterprise analyst
management consultant
process analyst
product manager
product owner
requirements engineer
systems analyst.
Responsibilities
As a business analyst, you'll need to:

communicate with internal colleagues to understand the needs of departments and the organisation as a whole
work with external stakeholders to understand and investigate feedback into the service, function or product provided
use data modelling practices to analyse your findings and create suggestions for strategic and operational improvements and changes
consider opportunities and potential risks attached to suggestions you make
identify the processes and information technology required to introduce your recommendations
gain agreement, usually from senior management, of the best method of introducing your recommendations to the business
communicate the benefits of your recommendations across departments and help to address any uncertainty and concern
produce written documentation to support your work, report on your findings and to present to stakeholders when necessary
support staff and teams in making your recommended changes, including helping to resolve any issues
ensure plans are made and processes are created to evaluate the impact of the changes made, including taking responsibility for overseeing and reporting on this evaluation.
Salary
Starting salaries for business analysts are between £21,000 and £31,000.
The average salary of a business analyst, with approximately five years' experience, ranges between £32,000 and £38,000.
Experienced business analysts can earn from £39,000 to in excess of £50,000.
Business analyst roles exist on a permanent basis in organisations, but you could also work on a freelance or contract basis once you've gained some relevant experience. As an experienced business analyst, you can expect to charge around £350 per day.

Income figures are intended as a guide only.

Working hours
Your working hours may vary, depending on whether you're a permanent employee (in which case you could expect to work full time, usually Monday to Fridays with some weekend work), or a contractor (where you may work longer hours during the week and sometimes weekends in order to complete project-based work within a specific timeframe).

You'll need a flexible approach to working extra hours when the need arises.

What to expect
You could make significant change and impact within your role, making a substantial difference to the success of a company and the satisfaction of its employees, both of which can be very rewarding.
You'll work to deadlines and juggle multiple projects, which gives lots of variety but can be stressful.
The role is largely office-based but will require travel to meet different internal and external stakeholders.
A high level of professionalism is required and formal dress is the norm.
Qualifications

Work experience
Business analysis exists in almost every sector, from not-for-profit organisations through to retail and the financial services. It's a fast-paced and competitive industry, so gaining work experience is essential.

You could apply for voluntary work with small enterprises to help improve a particular function of their organisation. This route might have a charitable focus.

Take advantage of any summer internship and placement opportunities provided on your course, they provide an excellent chance to gain first-hand, practical experience and skills.

You can also contact organisations directly to enquire about work shadowing, showing an enthusiasm for this area of work and for their business sector.

Employers
Business analysts are needed in the public and private sector, large multi-national companies and smaller independent enterprises. There is scope to work in this field whatever your sector interest may be. Employers may offer permanent employment, or fixed-term contracts to work on a specific project.

Many business analysts with industry experience work on a self-employed or consultancy basis.

Individual companies advertise their own business analyst positions, so search the websites of any organisations that appeal to you. You could make a speculative approach or use existing networks, such as those run by professional bodies and societies.

check the content and accuracy of maps, charts and printing proofs.
At a senior level, you'll need to:

take responsibility for a range of products (or all if in a small company)
manage budgets, staff and production schedules
cost out new business
liaise with other departments and with clients.
Salary
Starting salaries typically range from £18,000 to £22,000.
With experience, you can earn between £20,000 and £30,000.
At senior level, you'll typically earn around £30,000 to £47,000.
Experienced cartographers working on a consultancy basis will negotiate a fee with their client based on their experience and reputation.

Income figures are intended as a guide only.

Working hours
You'll usually work typical office hours (9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday). However, you may need to work longer hours when meeting publication or project completion deadlines.

What to expect
Jobs are available throughout the UK, with some posts, for example in government departments, centred near London and the south east.
Work is usually office based and you'll need to enjoy working in a team to meet project deadlines.
With experience you may be able to move into consultancy work. A small number of experienced cartographers go on to set up and run their own companies.
Being geographically mobile can be helpful, particularly when looking for your first job or for progressing your career.
There are opportunities to use your cartography skills abroad.
Qualifications
As there aren't any undergraduate degrees specifically in cartography, you'll typically need a degree in a spatial science. Relevant subjects include:

earth sciences
geographic information technologies
geographical information systems (GIS)
geography and geology
geomatics and geoinformatics
land surveying.
A degree in design, and computer science and software engineering can also be useful. Look for courses that include modules or courses in cartography.

photogrammetry
remote sensing
surveying.
It's also possible to get into cartography at trainee technician level straight from school or college. If you want to work in the public sector, you'll need GCSEs (or equivalent) in English language and maths, although sometimes geography is preferred. For entry at higher level, you'll need a minimum of five GCSEs, including maths and English, and two A-levels.

Skills
You'll need to show:

an interest in geography and the environment
a keen eye for detail as much of the work involves careful research and the collection and manipulation of data
an eye for layout and design, good spatial awareness and colour vision
IT literacy
analytical ability and problem-solving skills
teamworking skills in order to produce maps quickly and effectively
a methodical and systematic approach to work
high standards of accuracy and attention to set procedures
the ability to interpret data, graphical representations and symbols
the ability to work independently.
Knowledge of foreign languages can also be useful.

Work experience
As there aren't any dedicated cartography degree courses, you'll usually need to get a job first and receive training once employed. Practical experience gained through work placements or a year in industry as part of your degree can be helpful. Sandwich placements and internships are offered by large organisations such as Ordnance Survey (OS).

It's useful to put together a portfolio of any design ideas or maps you've produced to show at interview.

Employers
Cartographers work either in the public sector or with commercial cartography companies. The largest public sector employers are:

Ordnance Survey
Land & Property Services Northern Ireland
Defence Geographic Centre (part of the Ministry of Defence)
Hydrographic Office.
Other government departments such the Countryside Agency, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Department for Transport and the Forestry Commission also employ small numbers of cartographers.

You may also be employed by the planning departments of local authorities or by specialist bodies such as the British Antarctic Survey, British Geological Survey and The James Hutton Institute.

The Royal Air Force (air cartographers) and the Army (geographic technicians) also employ cartographers.

In the commercial sector, typical employers include:

publishing-based cartographers
utility companies, such as electricity, gas and water
oil companies
GIS companies
land and air survey companies
planning or environmental consultancies.
With experience it's also possible to become a freelance cartographer.

Look for job vacancies at:

British Cartographic Society
Society of Cartographers
discussion group lists, such as Carto-SoC and LIS-MAPS
websites of public sector and commercial companies employing cartographers.
Employers with vacancies may approach universities with departments that offer GIS or surveying-related degrees. Not all jobs are advertised as 'cartographer', so check job descriptions carefully.

As cartography is a relatively small profession, networking and word of mouth play a part in job hunting.

Professional development
Training usually takes place in-house and on the job. You'll focus on developing practical skills in areas such as:

compiling maps
map design and layout
map production (using a range of software packages).
In a larger company, you're likely to have the chance to rotate through different departments and may develop your skills in specialist areas such as GIS, photogrammetry and digital mapping. You might also receive external training in specific software packages.

If you're working for a smaller company, you may find there is less money available for training, although there may be more varied projects to work on helping you build up your skills.

Employers may also provide sponsorship for postgraduate study if you don't already have a Masters qualification. Check with prospective employers about opportunities for training and professional development.

Membership of the Society of Cartographers and the British Cartographic Society is also useful for exchanging information and networking with colleagues through a series of events and conferences.

Career prospects
Career progression depends to a certain extent on the size, structure and nature of the organisation you work for, as well as on your own qualities and motivation.

If you're working in the public sector you're more likely to have a structured promotion route. With experience, you can progress through established grades taking on greater responsibility for projects and decision-making, as well as for more junior staff. There may also be more opportunities to transfer to other parts of the business.

If you're working for a small company, you may need to be geographically flexible to advance. However, you may find the work more varied and interesting. As some commercial cartography companies form part of a larger group, you may find opportunities in other areas of the group.

There may be opportunities to become a specialist in areas such as GIS, photogrammetry, 3D visualisation, map animation or desktop publishing, which can open up further opportunities.

There are also opportunities for experienced cartographers to move into self-employment, in supplying a specialist product or service to other cartographic companies or publishers.

Professional development
Once you're working in the field, it's important to keep up to date with developments. You may be able to access industry information, events and networking opportunities through, for example:

BCS
IISP
Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)
Some employers, such as those offering graduate training schemes, may fund you to complete an MSc in information/cyber security while you're on the programme.

A part of GCHQ, NCSC lists bodies which they have certified to assess information assurance professionals. The GCHQ Certified Training (GCT) scheme offers courses at different levels: an 'awareness' level for those new to cyber security and an 'application' level which is more in-depth.

There are also various industry-related qualifications, such as:

Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) - an entry-level, IT certification for those with at least one year of experience.
The Certified Professional (CCP) scheme - the UK government's approved standard of competence for cyber security professionals. The scheme also provides those working in cyber security with a clearly defined career development path. There are different levels you can apply to - practitioner (entry level), senior practitioner and lead practitioner.
Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP) - you'll typically need at least four years of experience for this.
For those wanting to develop leadership, management and supervisory capabilities, there are a number of different certifications. These include the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) for practitioners with five years of relevant work experience.

Other relevant courses include Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Cloud Security, Cyber Incident, Planning and Response (CIPR) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) awareness.

Cyber security consultants can apply for the NCSC's Certified Consultancy scheme to receive certification. CCP certification is currently a prerequisite for this.

Career prospects
Cyber security is a fast-growing field and there is currently a skills shortage. Career prospects are good for people with the right combination of skills and experience.

You'll typically start in an entry-level or junior cyber security role. After building up several years of experience you could progress into roles such as senior cyber security analyst or consultant.

After significant experience in the field, you may be able to progress into higher level leadership and managerial roles, eventually progressing to become a director or head of cyber security. Achieving relevant certifications is helpful for your development and progression as many employers specify these as role requirements. 

Self-employment is an option, but most people first gain experience in the field. You could set up a cyber security company or work as an independent cyber security consultant.
